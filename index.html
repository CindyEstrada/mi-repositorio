          <h1>The Gunadule´s Sacred Geometry</h1>

            <p>
              Let's learn something about the worldview of the indigenous people
              called <i>Gunadules</i>. They have preserved much of their ancestral
              culture despite centuries of colonization and interaction with other
              cultures around the world.
            </p>
            <p>
              The respect they have for women is remarkable, there are rituals of
              the coming-of-age of girls and one of the main elements to protect
              them is the <i>Mola</i>. There are many protection Molas, these are
              visual representations of sacred narratives associated with the
              stars, animals, plants or minerals.
            </p>
            <p>
              According to Wikipedia (2009) Sacred Geometry<i> "ascribes symbolic
              and sacred meanings to certain geometric shapes and certain
              geometric proportions. It is associated with the belief that a god
              is the geometer of the world. The geometry used in the design and
              construction of religious structures such as churches, temples,
              mosques, religious monuments, altars, and tabernacles has sometimes
              been considered sacred. The concept applies also to sacred spaces
              such as temenoi, sacred groves, village greens, pagodas and holy
              wells, and the creation of religious art."</i>
            </p>
            <p>
              So, interpreting it from my point of view, the Molas are sacred
              geometry that protects women and therefore life on earth.
            </p>

            <h2>Where Gunadules live?</h2>

              <p>
                The self-denomination: Gunadule, is interpreted in their language
                as 'Men and women from the surface of the earth' (Castaño,
                Santacruz, 2012).  So, we could say that we are all Gunadule.
                Although the community itself, the Guna people <i>"live in three
                politically autonomous comarcas or autonomous reservations in
                Panama, and in a few small villages in Colombia. There are also
                communities of Guna people in Panama City, Colón, and other
                cities. Most Gunas live on small islands off the coast of the
                comarca of Guna Yala known as the San Blas Islands. The other
                two Guna comarcas in Panama are Kuna de Madugandíand Kuna de
                Wargandí. They are Guna-speaking people who once occupied the
                central region of what is now Panama and the neighboring San
                Blas Islands and still survive in marginal areas"</i>
                (Wikipedia, 2020).
              </p>
              <p>
                Although the political separation between Colombia and Panama has
                affected them as a community since 1903,<i> "the strength of their
                traditions and language maintain them together"</i>
                (Gutiérrez, 2018).
              </p>

            <h2>How do Molas protect women?</h2>

              <h3>Goaniggadi Mola</h3>

                <p>
                  Gunadule women learn to weave Molas from an early age together
                  with their mothers. "The Goaniggadi Mola, corresponds to the
                  figurative Molas with common elements of nature and are used
                  in everyday life" in women's clothing: shirts, shoes, bags...
                  the images emerge from the creativity of each weaver. These
                  molas are very commercial and have given economic support and
                  global recognition to the community.

              <h3>Mola Naga</h3>
                <p>
                  The "Mola Naga corresponds to the Molas of Protection, Molas
                  associated with the origin stories of the Gunadule people, which
                  have their own name: Yala Burba Mola, Nibali Mola, Naggurus Mola,
                  among others; and they are used mainly in the ceremonies of the
                  passage from girl to woman. They are used in the puberty parties
                  Sumba Inna: the first menstruation and Inna Dummadi: ritual of
                  freedom, also in Iggo Inna: ritual of the nose ring
                  (Castaño, Santacruz, 2012).
